# heroku-datadog-services

**NO LONGER SUPPORTED**

As of February 2025, this repository is no longer supported - and is not recommended, as it does not work with the latest versions of Datadog's Heroku buildpack.

It remains online for reference, but using Datadog's [`prerun.sh` approach](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/basic_agent_usage/heroku/#prerun-script) is a better path forward.
